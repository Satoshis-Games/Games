## Intro
Super Bro needs to exit the world of Super Mario. Satoshi Nakamoto is kidnapped. The entire world is powered by ASICs. You need to change this. Only 3 lives â€“ Only 100 seconds per level.


## How to Play:

Classic Super Mario based game. Jump on enemies. Often, this is the only way to defeat them. Koopas (the turtle-like creatures) and Buzzy Beetles will turn into a shell when jumped on. Hitting the shell will send it gliding. You will get extra points if it hits other enemies. Goombas can be defeated when stepped on, but you'll have to butt-bounce if you have mini Mario. You can shoot fire at most enemies as well (and get a coin as a reward). However, shooting fire at Dry Bones has no effect. Step on Dry Bones to stun him for a short while.

Sometimes, it is impossible to jump onto something without getting a fast start on your jump. Before jumping, run up to the object with B or Y on the Direction Pad.

The levels in Super Bro have loads of blocks. Some blocks have question marks, which either have a coin, a red mushroom, a green 1UP mushroom, or a fire flower. A red mushroom makes you grow into Super Mario, and a fire flower lets you shoot fireballs at enemies, Coins are worth satoshis. 1 coin = 1 Satoshi. Make sure to hit regular blocks also. Many contain nothing, but some have items or even several coins in them. Invisible blocks also exist, though they can be difficult to find. Some blocks have a button. Press down on it and a change will be set, such as blocks changing to coins or a tube.

Unless absolutely necessary, never stop running. Remember, you have a time limit to finish the level, and the faster you get through the more satoshis you can withdraw when you rescue the Queen Miss Satoshi.
