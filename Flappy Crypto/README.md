## About

Based on the compo's rules, the concepts
that we tried to incorporate are fork, branch, push, pull, clone associated with a crypto theme.

You are pappu in the game, a little character. You need to
click the mouse or tap (touch screen) to levitate or else
pappu will descend. If he hits the top or bottom boundaries
that will end the game.

There will be some obstacles along the way like forks, branches
and some enemies who are also known as "pakias". Hitting them
will end the game. 3 types of pakias - sad (pull you),
happy (push you), angry (kill you). Keep safe distance from
them!

There are some collectibles too! Coins for points (BTC for 50,
LTC for 100, ETH for 500, XMR for 1000). Stars for invincibility
for a short period. Berries spawning clones that'll destroy
anything that comes in their way!

Collisions are not super strict to make the gameplay a little less harder.

Hit Enter or Spacebar keys to (re)start the game.
