Try to find the mysterious and dangerous boss before leaving the island,
be careful.

## Controls:

**Button 1** (C/Z/N): open inventory/cancel menu

## Quick Start:

Avoid zombies (water is your friend)
Open your inventory and select the workbench
Place the workbench on the ground
Use the workbench to craft a wood axe
Select the wood axe in your inventory

Search the island until you find a cave opening
You can pick up your workbench again to move it near the cave.

## Background:
Bcraft is a crafting game made using Pico 8. The game is heavily inspired by Notch's Ludum Dare entry "Minicraft" which seemed a perfect idea for pico 8.
