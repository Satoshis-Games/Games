## Intro
Grid is a boy with few friends in school, last night he discovered a digital currency in the famous bitcointalk.org forum, help him get more Bitcoins and avoid Zombies and rats who come to steal his private keys at night!

## How to Play:

Clear as many rows and columns as possible either by swapping them or touching them (yes does work on the phone!). As you proceed through Grid, other RPG objectives (such as reaching a certain score to receive access to better armor or magic spells) will become more common. The more days a player survives in the game, the harder it gets.


## Quick Start:
Usually, your goal in Grid is to clear as many rows and columns as possible in as few moves as possible. You can clear crypto pieces from the board by lining up three (or more) in a row, which is accomplished by swapping pieces of crypto pieces in order to create three of a kind.

The initial objective of Grid is to survive during the nights. The game is a mix of Candy Crash + RPG game. During the mornings the player needs to clear as many rows as possible to farm and build construction that provides him with upgrades. During the night the player needs to defend itself against monsters, therefore he needs to clear as minimum rows as possible, as some pieces invoke monsters and other invoke swords, armor and other RPG elements that are unlocked during the mornings.

## Background:
There is a puzzle in a grid to solve, while above it a survival story is being developed. Level up by killing enemies, learn magic spells, build a fort and do not let others steal you. The more days you survive the harder it gets. The final boss (Dragon) is really powerful. In the puzzle, there are funny crypto elements that you have to pair.
